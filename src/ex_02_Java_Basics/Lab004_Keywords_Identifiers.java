// Keywords are reserved words in Java that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used for naming variables,
// methods, classes, or other identifiers.

// Identifiers, on the other hand, are names that you create to identify variables, methods, classes, and other entities in your code.
// Identifiers must follow certain rules,such as starting with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and cannot be the same as keywords.
// In the provided code, `package`, `public`, `class`, 'void', and `static` (5) are keywords, while
// `Lab004_Keywords_Identifiers` and `main` are identifiers.
