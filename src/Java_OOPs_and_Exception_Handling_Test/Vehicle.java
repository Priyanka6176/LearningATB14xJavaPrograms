public class Vehicle {
    //Vehicle Inheritance Hierarchy
    //Create a Vehicle base class with start() method. Create Car and Bike subclasses that override the start() method.
    //
    //Examples:
    //Input:
    //Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Bike()}; call start() on each
    //Output:
    //Car engine starts with a roar! Bike engine starts with a purr!
    //💡 Explanation:Demonstrate runtime polymorphism where the actual method called depends on the object type, not the reference type.
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
