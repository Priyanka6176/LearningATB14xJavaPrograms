    //Animal Sound Polymorphism
    //Create a class "Animal" and subclasses "Dog" and "Cat". Override a method to make each animal make a sound.
    //
    //Examples:
    //Input:
    //Create Dog and Cat objects and call makeSound()
    //Output:
    //Dog says: Woof! Woof! Cat says: Meow! Meow!
    //💡 Explanation:Demonstrate method overriding where each subclass provides its own implementation of the makeSound() method.
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}
